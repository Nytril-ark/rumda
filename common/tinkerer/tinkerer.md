# Hello Tinkerer!

### What just happened?

You triggered the Rumda theme switch script **without** using the official installer. 
This is totally fine! We detected this and took some precautions.


### What we did:
1. **Backed up your configs** - All your existing configuration files have been backed up in place. 
   - Hyprland config
   - Hyprlock config
   - Alacritty config  
   - etc..

### Your backups are located at:
```
~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf.tinkerer-backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml.tinkerer-backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
... (and so on)
```
Things will go smoother from now on, next themeswitches won't backup. I really recommend using the install script though!

## Questions?

Check the main README.md or open an issue on GitHub.

Enjoy!
