## RUMDA!
### my hyprland dots
This is a WIP that *might* not work for you out of the box. I plan on cleaning it up **very** soon, and I'll add better features. Stay tuned!


Big thanks to xfcasio, as this is a modified version of his rice, Amadeus.

### notes:
the colorscheme for the editor could be found at /.config/rumda/nvim/lua/themes/
**the rumda-light and rumda-dark are more reliable**, the other 2 are still
experimental.
