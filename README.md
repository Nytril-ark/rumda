### Rumda the cat

Rumda the cat should be the main feature in these dotfiles. Sadly however, I am stuck with many side-projects, so I can't fully finish this widget yet. Here, Rumda is stuck too:

![rumda-trapped](pictures/RumdaIsTrapped.gif)

The cat widget ~might~ will (insha'allah) be able to get out soon. We'll see! 
Currently, the cat on top of the bar just does a ~goofy~ jump-out animation when you click it. If you click on its resting spot again, it comes back.

PS: the cat face at the bottom of the bar is an internet widget. if it's smiling, you're connected :)


### theme switcher
I kick off the cat for a little fun
